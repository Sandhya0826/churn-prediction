 This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time. With the growing number of online transactions, detecting fraudulent activities has become a critical task for financial institutions. Fraudulent transactions can lead to significant financial losses and reputational damage, so itâ€™s essential to develop an efficient system that can identify suspicious activity quickly and accurately.

The project will leverage a dataset containing historical credit card transactions, where each transaction is labeled as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. Using various machine learning algorithms, the goal is to classify these transactions and flag those that are likely to be fraudulent.
