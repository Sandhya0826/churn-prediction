 This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast customer churn in a subscription-based service or business. Customer churn refers to the loss of customers over time, which can significantly affect the growth and profitability of a subscription business. By identifying customers who are likely to churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain these customers, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce churn rates.

The project will use historical customer data, including features like customer demographics, usage behavior, transaction history, and engagement metrics, to train machine learning models that predict the likelihood of a customer churning. The goal is to build an accurate, interpretable model that can help businesses make data-driven decisions to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
